In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with string comparisons, especially within conditional statements.  The loose comparison operator (`==`) can lead to unexpected results when comparing strings that might appear identical but have different internal representations. For instance, comparing '007' (string) and 7 (integer) with `==` would evaluate to true in PHP, but a strict comparison (`===`) would yield false, reflecting their different types.

Consider this scenario:
```php
$string1 = '10';
$string2 = '10.0';

if ($string1 == $string2) {
  echo "Strings are equal (loose comparison)";
}

if ($string1 === $string2) {
  echo "Strings are equal (strict comparison)";
}
```
This code will only print "Strings are equal (loose comparison)" because loose comparison coerces the values to match.  Strict comparison recognizes the type difference and correctly evaluates the comparison to false. This can be a cause of hard-to-find bugs if the programmer is unaware of how `==` differs from `===`.
This behavior stems from PHP's type juggling. While convenient, it can also introduce unexpected behavior if strict type comparisons aren't implemented. Therefore it is always recommended to use the strict comparison (`===`) operator to avoid such implicit type coercion unless you have a very specific reason for loose comparison
